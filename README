A shoes implementation of Conway's Game of Life:
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

Why?
Because I wanted to try-out "Shoes"
And because the Game of Life is pretty cool:
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcuBvj0pw-E

So, after installing Ruby-Shoes* try running:
shoes ./script/life_app.rb

Alternatively, because I hope-to (someday maybe) factor 'shoes'
out of the game, you can interact w/ my Life class(es):
./script/test_app.rb

Finally to package:
 o  install shoes (in parallel directory)
    ../shoes (see: https://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/Building-Shoes-on-Mac-OS-X-10.6-and-10.7)
 o use rake to compile the app & create its installer:
    $ cd ../shoes
    $ rake APP=../life
    $ rake APP=../life installer


*Note: I setup an alias (Unix-alias) to the shoes executable
